Going at a steady pace, the hike includes a walk on the ridge of Italy’s famously feisty volcano, allowing incredible views down into the crater itself. After a pizza lunch, head to Pompeii to see the havoc that Mount Vesuvius reaped on it in AD 79. Tour the UNESCO-listed excavations, seeing fossils and well-preserved ruins while hearing the horrors that befell this intriguing ancient city. Mt Vesuvius is inaccessible from November 20 to March 31. During this time, the hike is replaced with a visit to the iconic City of Naples. We’ll take a panoramic bus tour and have some free time to walk around the city centre.",
