## Prerequisites

Components required to run this application

HyperVisor/ Virtualisation enabled in BIOS
minikube 1.16
kubectl: 1.20.1
VirtualBox  6.1.10_Ubuntu r138449
Ubuntu 20.04 recommended, Windows may be possible with correct network configuration for VirtualBox.
## How to run the application with Spring Boot

Step-by-step instructions of how to run this program

1. Run the service in a terminal, for instance, Flight Service - mvn spring-boot:run -pl flights

2. Run in separate terminals: Travel Agent - mvn spring-boot:run "-Dspring-boot.run.arguments=http://localhost:8081/flights" -pl travel_agent

3. Run in another separate terminal, the Client - mvn spring-boot:run -pl client 
Ensure that variables argsRequest and argsResponse are set to point to localhost:8081
	public static final String argsRequest = "http://localhost:8081/travelagent/travelpackagerequests";
	public static final String argsResponse = "http://localhost:8081/travelagent/bookings";

4. When the Client application is running, open a new browser and enter into the url the following - http://localhost:8082/

5. Enter your travel details into displayed form.

## Running with docker-compose

1. Run (sudo) docker-compose build && docker-compose up.

2. Ensure that variables argsRequest and argsResponse are set to point to localhost:8081
	public static final String argsRequest = "http://localhost:8081/travelagent/travelpackagerequests";
	public static final String argsResponse = "http://localhost:8081/travelagent/bookings";

3. Recompile client module via "mvn clean compile -pl client"

4. Run client ("mvn spring-boot:run -pl client") and open webpage at localhost:8080.

5. Eureka dashboard can be accessed at "http://localhost:8761/"

## Running with Kubernetes

Configuration:

Please note that a successful Kubernetes run was achieved using Ubuntu 20.04.1 . Attempts were made with Windows, but crashed when access via NodePort was 
attempted, due to suspected VirtualBox configuration issues.

minikube 1.16
kubectl: 1.20.1
VirtualBox  6.1.10_Ubuntu r138449

Docker images are pulled from Docker Hub (conchobar/${IMAGE_NAME}).

1. In a terminal, run "minikube start" to spin up minikube in VB. Initial run may take several minutes.

2. After successful instantiation of minikube, run "minikube dashboard" to open the Kubernetes dashboard in the default browser. 

3. In the k8s folder, run "kubectl apply -f ." to spin up pods/services in minikube. Initial pull from Docker Hub will be over 300MB, so make take time
depending on internet connection.

4. Obtain minikube IP address by running "minikube ip". This value will need to be applied to the client/src/main/java/Client.java in linel 37/38, as IP address is machine dependent.
    public static final String argsRequest = "http://${minikube ip}:31500/travelagent/travelpackagerequests";
	public static final String argsResponse = "http://${minikube ip}:31500/travelagent/bookings";

5. Recompile client module via "mvn clean compile -pl client"

6. Run client ("mvn spring-boot:run -pl client") and open webpage at localhost:8080.

It may take several minutes for all services to correctly register with the Eureka servers initially. The server dashboard can be viewed in a browser at http://#{minikube ip}:32001.
